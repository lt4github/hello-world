# What is Data Visualization?
*by [Jack Dougherty](introduction/who.md), last updated February 28, 2017*

Data visualization is broadly defined as a method of encoding quantitative, relational, or spatial information into images. Classic examples include [Charles Menard's figurative map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard) of Napoleon's defeat and retreat during the Russian campaign of 1812, and [John Snow's dot map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow) of cholera cases during the London epidemic of 1854.

This free online introductory book focuses on selected topics in data visualization:

**Charts and maps:** Despite the growing variety of visualization types, this book features chapters on creating [charts](../chart) and [maps](../map), and a wide range of ways to communicate with these classic models.

**Reusable tools and templates:** Unlike infographics created for one-time use, all of the tools and templates in this book are recyclable, and allow you to upload a new dataset to display your story.

**Free and easy-to-learn:** We have selected data visualization tools that are free to use (or work on a freemium model, where advanced features or higher usage requires payment), and searched for those that we believe are easy-to-learn, based on our teaching experience with undergraduate students and non-profit community organizations.

**Interactive on the open web:** Many books assume that you will deliver your data visualizations to in-person audiences on printed paper or presentation slides. But in this book, we show how to [embed interactive charts and maps on your website](../embed), to share with the wider public.

**Storytelling:** Data visualization is more than pretty pictures. In this book, the best visualizations are those that [tell your data story](../story) -- and pull readers' attention to what really matters -- by combining images and text, and offering exploration with explanation.
